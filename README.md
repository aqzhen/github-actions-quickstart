# github-actions-quickstart

Feedback: I wasn't sure how to configure the branch and pull request settings for my commit. It would be nice if there was a link to configuring these settings from the CLI.

Workflow: Created a GitHub workflow to automate the deployment of the static site. This workflow automates the process of building and deploying a Hugo website to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository.
